To ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase, I implemented Observer, Decorator, and Factory design patterns, leveraging object-oriented principles in C++. I also integrated the XQuartz library to render dynamic graphics, enhancing both gameplay interaction and the overall visual experience.

                    <div className="project_content_desc_desc">I designed and built a full-stack calculator web application that records and manages calculation data using a MongoDB database. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, handled database interactions and supported CRUD operations, which I tested and refined through Postman. On the frontend, I developed a React.js interface styled with CSS and designed in Figma, ensuring a clean, user-friendly experience that integrated seamlessly with the backend for real-time updates.

Mushroom, a 3D single-player Unity game developed in C#, where players race against the clock to collect 10 mushrooms within two minutes. To build the immersive environment, I utilized imported assets to construct a 3D background and employed Unityâ€™s Animator Controller to synchronize character movements with keyboard inputs. This project combined technical scripting with creative design, resulting in an engaging, interactive gameplay experience.</div>
